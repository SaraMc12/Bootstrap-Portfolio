                This project was the first group class project I had in my Bootcamp. In a team of 5 we had two weeks to brainstorm and create an entire website equipped with multiple APIs and the use of a “new technology”. The site currently resides under out PMs name which is why the link says Matthew.
                This project was meaningful to me because I was tasked with the UI/UX of the landing page and the final page where the client can order a ride. I chose to take on learning a new technology by designing it in Materialize. 
                As the UX/UI designer I really wanted to put my focus on the client. Before I did any coding, I first created some a character to represent our client and scenarios. Then, based off that information I used a tool called Balsamiq to make mockups of the entire site which I presented to my team.
“Philimena” is a young adult, preoccupied with the frustrations of a last-minute flight cancelation leaving her stranded at an airport away from home.

                I told my team that our app should make the process of finding a last minute hotel so simple that from the moment the user opens the app, to the time they get to baggage claim to retrieve their remaining luggage they will have their  hotel booked AND their ride called. I also stated that the process should be able to be completed one handed as most travelers have at least one carry on that they will be holding. I did this by designing the search bar to be large and equipped with an autofill option as well as a large brightly colored button below.
                For the emotional side of things, I wanted the website to be a bright and bold with a cheerful color palette and have a bit of humor to it to lighten the mood of the user.
                My aspirational goals for the future of this app would be to eventual link up the blog to a geolocation so it will feature information about local shows, restaurants and other entertainment options based on wherever the user is.
