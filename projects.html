                In a team of five, we had two weeks to brainstorm and create an entire website equipped with multiple APIs and the use of a “new technology.” The site currently resides under our PM’s name, Matthew.
                This project was meaningful to me because I was able to serve as the team’s UX/UI designer and put my focus squarely on the client. Specifically, I was tasked with the UX/UI of the landing page and the final page where the customer can order a ride. For this project, I chose learn a new front-end framework, Materialize. 
                Before diving into the coding process, I created a persona to represent our customer, along with scenarios she might face. With the customer in mind, I used Balsamiq to make mockups of the entire site.

                Our virtual client Philomena, is a young adult, preoccupied with the frustrations of a last-minute flight cancellation that leaves her stranded at an airport. Thinking about how her journey might unfold, I suggested to my team that our app should make the process of finding a last-minute hotel so simple that she will have her hotel booked and ride called in the short time it takes to exit the plane and retrieve her remaining luggage at baggage claim. I also specified that the process should be easy to complete one handed, as most travelers have at least one carry-on to lug around.

                To meet these objectives, I designed the search bar to be large and equipped with an autofill option. For the emotional side of things, I drew upon my illustration and sketch writing background to create a bold and cheerful color palette, along with a bit of humor to lighten the mood of the user.
                I hope to further develop the project concept by considering the customer’s experience beyond arriving at the hotel. Namely, I want to address her potential boredom by linking the blog to a geolocation, so that the app features information about local shows, restaurants, and other entertainment options.
