          <p><img src="./assets/GreenmanPoster.jpg"

            In this project I designed a t-shirt for an art festival in my home state of Maryland. This was a challenge on many levels as the client had been inspired by a painting which he did not have a copy of and was only able to describe the concept. Mother earth and the Greenman sharing half a face. One representing flowers, sunlight and golden fields and the other representing dense dark forest, two faces that also looked like one. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I had only 3 weeks to work on this piece from concept to completion due to the fact that I had been brought onto the project late in planning when their original artist had decided to pull her design form the festival. I had not only my client providing notes and feedback but the entire board of directors in charge of the festival. Although, I was not able to see the unveiling of my shirt or attend the festival I was told that it sold out in record time and was the only shirt to go on backorder. The picture was inspired by Artist Alphonse Mucha.
