            After Laith the lion I was approached by another writer about doing a 3-part children’s book series. This is the first of them. His goal was to make a comical book for young readers that could also be enjoyed by all ages including parents.
            He wanted me to design images where the readers could always discover something new each time they looked at it. Kind of like where’s Waldo, but nowhere near that involved otherwise, I would never finish 😉.

            It was fun creating so many characters, 12 main characters and two additional supporting characters. To really help me in this process I gave each character a backstory to help me figure out what types of scenarios they might wind up in based on where they were and really allow them to have a unique personality that the readers could follow along with. The book is in its final editing stages and should be available for sale by December.
