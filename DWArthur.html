            The PBS kids spotlight videos were introduced to showcase female and minority characters as an effort to create more inclusion to PBS's young audience. I was first tasked with a show that was all too familiar and one I enjoyed watching as a child. Arthur, with the focus being on his little sister DW. What was both fun and challenging about this project was that I had always known DW as “the troublesome sister” who was not always shown in the best light.

            Back when Arthur was originally created it was in the days where little girls were “annoying, bossy, and troublesome.” Think about Suzie form Calvin and Hobbes, or Lisa from the Simpsons. It was a different world in the 90's and PBS wanted to make sure it was moving up with the times. As I was unable to rewrite the first few seasons of the show, I instead worked on a way to rebrand DW's image as a brave, smart little girl who always keeps her big brother on his toes. With the takeaway being that girls who speak their mind are should be respected and valued as they are the leaders of tomorrow. I'm happy to have worked on this project and be a part of helping introduce strong female characters to a young audience.
